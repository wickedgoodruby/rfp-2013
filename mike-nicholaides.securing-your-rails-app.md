# Securing Your Rails App #

## by Mike Nicholaides ##

### Abstract ###

How can you know if your Rails app is safe? With potential vulnerabilities lurking in your app's code, in gems you depend on, in services you use, and in the Rails source itself, attackers have myriad vectors to gain access to your data, interrupt your service, and damage your reputation.

In this talk, I'll cover the basics of securing your Rails app, evaluating and mitigating the risk inherent in live web applications, and strategies for keeping your app secure as new threats emerge.

### Additional Notes ###

This talk has not been given elsewhere.

I have been a Rails consultant since 2006 and have performed Rails security audits for numerous financial institutions and other organizations with highly sensitive data.
